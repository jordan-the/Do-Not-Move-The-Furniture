                    <p> This web application is designed by Do Not Move The Furniture.<br>
                    It is designed to record the artifacts information.<br> 
                    For now it does not include access control. <br>
                    When it does, everyone get to write their own stories about the artifacts they have.<br>
                    We have created fake data to display what it should look like. <br>
                    Thank you for your time. </p>
